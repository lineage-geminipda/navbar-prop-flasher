Tweak.prop
==========

About
-----

Tweak.prop is a small yet powerful script to make permanent changes to Android's
`/system/build.prop` more easily or even completely automated.

Usage
-----

Run either of the two following commands:

Disable navbar
./zipit disable

Enable navbar
./zip enable

These can be edited by going into either folder and editing the tmp/tweak.prop to set whatever props you want
